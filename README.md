# fraud_detection
This fraud_detection aims to help to protect from fraud credit card transcation
Introduction:
This Python script aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using a decision tree model. It outlines the process of importing data, preprocessing it, and building a model for identification of fraudulent activities.

Data Import and Preprocessing:
The script starts by importing necessary libraries and configuring the environment settings. Following that, it retrieves the fraud-detection dataset from a specified source and decompresses it into the '/kaggle/input' directory. Upon downloading, the dataset is loaded into a pandas DataFrame where initial preprocessing steps are executed. Missing entries in numerical columns are handled through imputation, employing strategies such as using the median or replacing with 0 for binary variables. Categorical variables undergo factorization (label encoding) for numerical representation.

Model Building:
The data is divided into features (X) and the target variable (y), using a 70-30 split for train-test separation. Subsequently, a decision tree classifier is constructed and fitted with the training dataset. The model then makes predictions on the test dataset. The script calculates and presents metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score in a classification report.

Usage:
To execute the script, ensure that the required dependencies are installed. Users can refer to the script for specific instructions regarding any additional setup.

Example Output:
Upon running the script, users can expect to see an output displaying the accuracy of the model along with a detailed classification report containing metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.

Credits and License:
The dataset used in this project is credited to [source], and any applicable licenses are mentioned accordingly.

By adhering to this format, users can gain a comprehensive understanding of the script's purpose and instructions for utilizing it effectively.
